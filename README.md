# Cozy Zelda

This is an Opera GX mod based on Zelda backgrounds and OSTs. I wanted to keep some sort of a cozy ambiance that fits well with the backgrounds.


## Installation

First, clone or download the repository. Then use the "load unpacked" option in opera://extensions after enabling the **developer mode**.


## Todo

- Customize browser sounds
- Customize keyboard sounds
- Add some web modding
- Add some shaders ?

## Credits

I used the OSTs that [pp3k07](https://www.youtube.com/@pp3k07) reuploaded.
